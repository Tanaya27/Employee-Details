This C++ code defines a structure `employee` to store details of employees such as name, age, phone number, and salary. 
It then creates an array of `employee` objects and initializes them with sample data. 
Finally, it calls a `display` function to print the details of all employees to the console.

Here's a description of what the code does:
1. It defines a structure `employee` with members for name, age, phone number, and salary.
2. It creates an array of `employee` objects to store details of multiple employees.
3. It initializes each `employee` object with sample data using assignment statements.
4. It defines a `display` function that takes the array of `employee` objects and the number of employees as arguments.
5. The `display` function iterates over the array and prints the details of each employee to the console in a tabular format.
6. In the `main` function, it creates an array of `employee` objects, initializes them with sample data, and then calls the `display` function to print the details of all employees.

This code can be useful for managing employee data in a small-scale application or as a demonstration of working with structures and arrays in C++. 
It provides a simple yet effective way to organize and display employee information.
